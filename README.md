# Brainfuck4J
Fast Java interpreter for Brainfuck language with optimizations, memory management and multi dialect support

## What is Brainfuck?
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. <br>
Notable for its extreme minimalism, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

## How to add this to your project
### Gradle/Maven
To use Brainfuck4J with Gradle/Maven you can use this [Maven server](https://maven.lenni0451.net/#/releases/de/florianmichael/Brainfuck4J) or [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#FlorianMichael/Brainfuck4J).  
You can also find instructions how to implement it into your build script there.

### Jar File
If you just want the latest jar file you can download it from the GitHub [Actions](https://github.com/FlorianMichael/Brainfuck4J/actions) or use the [Release](https://github.com/FlorianMichael/Brainfuck4J/releases).

## Structure
### Dialect mappings
```java
public record Dialect(
        String name, 
        String increase_memory_pointer, String decrease_memory_pointer,
        String increase_value, String decrease_value, 
        String start_loop, String end_loop,
        String get_char, String put_char
) {}
```

All undocumented methods and classes are parts of the internals.

## Example usage
### Execute a basic brainfuck code
```java
final Brainfuck4J test = new Brainfuck4J(() -> {
    System.out.println("Code was executed!");
});
 
test.run(System.in, System.out, MemoryTypes.INTEGER.create(6000), ">++++++[<++++++>-]<.");
```
### Converting Dialects
```java
final String trollScriptSource = Dialect.convert(">++++++[<++++++>-]<.", Dialect.BRAINFUCK, Dialect.TROLLSCRIPT);
```
